    "Mexican telecommunications group America Movil SAB de CV (NYSE:AMX) said it had further raised to 7.86% its stake in Dutch telecommunications and ICT services provider Royal KPN NV (AMS:KPN) via the purchase of additional stock in three separate transactions outside regular market trading.  America Movil bought further eight million KPN shares in total, of which 1.7m stock for EUR7.80 (USD9.75) a piece in one deal, another 5.8m shares at EUR7.85 in a second transaction and 500,000 shares in a third deal, also at EUR7.85 a share.  The Mexican group held 4.8% in KPN before launching on 30 May its EUR2.6bn partial offer aimed at increasing its KPN stake to 27.7%. The offer, at EUR8.00 a share, will run until 27 June, unless extended.  AMX is using this deal to expand outside the Americas, as it views geographic diversification to be key to its growth, having so far provided increased profit and cash flow stability as well as strong ratings, it has said.  KPN's management and supervisory boards, however, see the offer as opportunistic and undervaluing the company's potential and had advised shareholders not to tender their stock to it. They also said that the bid fails to reflect the value derived from KPN's current transition of its Dutch business and its profitable growth in Germany and Belgium.  As an alternative, the Dutch group's boards have proposed to start a strategic review of the company's German business E-Plus in addition to the ongoing review of its Belgian mobile operations, as they expect such a move to unlock superior value for shareholders.  For AMX, this is its largest investment in Europe so far, it has said, adding it would use own cash resources to finance it. | Financial News",
